Assignemnt-7
Write C++ program for storing binary number using doubly
linked lists. Write functions- a) To compute 1„s and 2„s complement b)
Add two binary numbers

Assignemnt-8
Write C++ program for storing appointment schedule for day. Appointments
are booked randomly using linked list. Set start and end time and min and
max duration for visit slot. Write functions for- a) Display free slots b) Book
appointment c) Cancel appointment (check validity, time bounds,
availability) d) Sort list based on time e) Sort list based on time using
pointer manipulation

Assignemnt-9
In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to
unbalancing delimiter such as (),{},[]. Write C++ program using
stack to check whether given expression is well parenthesized or
not.

Assignemnt-10
Implement C++ program for expression conversion as infix to
postfix and its evaluation using stack based on given
conditions: 1. Operands and operator, both must be single
character. 2. Input Postfix expression must be in a desired
format. 3. Only '+', '-', '*' and '/ ' operators are expected.

Assignemnt-11
Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a
typical example is the creation of a job queue by an operating
system. If the operating system does not use priorities, then
the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system.
Write C++ program for simulating job queue. Write
functions to add job, display job and delete job from queue.

Assignemnt-12
Write program to implement a priority queue in C++ using
an order list/array to store the items in the queue. Create a
class that includes the data items (which should be template)
and the priority (which should be int). The order list/array
should contain these objects, with operator <= overloaded so
that the items with highest priority appear at the beginning of
the list/array (which will make it relatively easy to retrieve the
highest item.)

Assignemnt-13
A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be
made at either end. Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a one dimensional array. 
Write C++ program to simulate deque with functions to add and delete elements from either end of the deque.
